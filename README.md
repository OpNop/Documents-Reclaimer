# Documents Reclaimer
Tack back your Documents folder (or any folder for that matter)! Poor development decisions have lead to a cluttered Documents folder even though we have had a Windows provided folder since Windows Vista for developers to store their game related files. ***Enough is enough***, With this tool you can take back control over your folders, on a visual level at least. What it does is move the files to a folder specified by you and then create a "Junction" from the old folder to the new one, and hides the junction.
